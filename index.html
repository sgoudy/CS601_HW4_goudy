                *** SEEKING REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES in Aviation or Automotive ***
            </p>
            <p>I'm a former Marine Corps Officer and Aviator. I served for a decade as an Osprey pilot (those helicopter/ plane combo things (MV-22B)). I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I am now enjoying civilian life even more thanks to some horses.</p>
    
            <p>I decided I wanted to be able to work from home... got my <strong>MBA</strong>, and then randomly discovered software. I haven't looked back since. Surprisingly, I do find it just as (if not even more so) stimulating as flying. I love challenging my brain and can't wait to see where I end up.</p>
             
           <p>I'm a huge gear-head and tinkerer. I love making things work so I'm hoping I could land somewhere in the <strong>automotive or aviation sector, as stated above.</strong></p>
    
            <p>I volunteer at a ranch up the road everyday and work with the horses. They have been lifesaving and great for my soul. A lot of folks will never understand the difficulties in transitioning from active duty to the civilian world. I hope that I can take my experiences and share it with others that might need help.</p>
